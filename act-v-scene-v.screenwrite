INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

TIMOTHY is unconcious, and there is equipment hooked all up and down to his body, making noises. BIAN is crying beside his bandaged 
head. She is reaching in to her pocket. She is pulling out a knife. She is slicing her throat open. Her body is splaying onto TIMOTHY, 
turning his sheats red, as they spin into darkness, and nothing else said.
